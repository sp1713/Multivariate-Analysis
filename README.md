In the given Diabetes dataset we have the following columns and their meaning:
(1)	Date in MM-DD-YYYY format 
(2)	Time in XX:YY format 
(3)	Code 
(4)	Value 

The Code field is deciphered as follows: 

33 = Regular insulin dose 
34 = NPH insulin dose 
35 = UltraLente insulin dose 
48 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement 
57 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement 
58 = Pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement 
59 = Post-breakfast blood glucose measurement 
60 = Pre-lunch blood glucose measurement 
61 = Post-lunch blood glucose measurement 
62 = Pre-supper blood glucose measurement 
63 = Post-supper blood glucose measurement 
64 = Pre-snack blood glucose measurement 
65 = Hypoglycemic symptoms 
66 = Typical meal ingestion 
67 = More-than-usual meal ingestion 
68 = Less-than-usual meal ingestion 
69 = Typical exercise activity 
70 = More-than-usual exercise activity 
71 = Less-than-usual exercise activity 
72 = Unspecified special event

From this dataset we can analyze that during what time of the day does the diabetic patient has the highest blood glucose measured
using the Pre and post breakfast,lunch,supper and snack blood glucose measurement codes and according to this measurement what kind of insulin dose should be given to the patient 
among regular, NPH and UltraLente and up to what range
